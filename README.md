### Problem statement
I once double parked my car to run an errand. It took a lot of time to complete my errand. When I returned, I saw because I had double parked the car I was blocking a strangers car. As fate would have it he was in a hurry and was angry because my car was blocking him. I wondered could there be a way he could have contacted me. \

### Solution
In order  for him to contact me he would need some contact detail. But sticking your personal contact detail on your car isn't really a good idea. That is when I thought of tagger. It is a unique qr code which will be a point of contact between the tag creater and tag scanner. \
